# OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)

![OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)](screenshots/screenshot-opencv-demonstrator.png "OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)")


## Introduction

This open source **OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)**, originally developped by
[TSD Conseil](http://www.tsdconseil.fr), is now through this GitHub
repository opened to user contributions. With the help of the OpenCV
community we can make a very exciting product!

Screenshots and stable binary releases are available on the
[official OpenCV demonstrator web page](http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html).

The project is written in C++. The following open source libraries are used:

- [OpenCV 3.0](http://opencv.org/) - a real-time computer vision library
- [gtkmm 3](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/) library for the GUI part
- [pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) for XML parsing


## Pre-built binaries

If you just want to try OpenCV without having to write any line of code, or if
you want to just test the OpenCV demonstrator, you can simply download and
install the lastest stable binary package, which can be found on the
[OpenCV demonstrator web page](http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html)
(for now only Windows binary installer is available, but a `.deb` should be
available soon).


## Build from source

If you want to build the demonstrator from the source code, please follow the
build instructions that are located in the file
[doc/build-instructions.md](doc/build-instructions.md).


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to add your own demonstration, please
have a look to the
[tutorial for adding a new demonstration item](doc/tutorial-new-demo.md).


## Road map

- Better documentation and clean-up of the code to enable easier contributions from the community
- Better support for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX (detailled build instructions, binary packages)
- Improve localization (e.g. translations)
- Increase coverage of OpenCV functions
- Tests
- GUI improvements (multiple filters, scripting support, etc.)

**Note:** For a detailled description of forecasted technical enhancements,
please have a look at the list issues tagged as "enhancement".
